This project is an introductory assignment for an introductory course in Java. I thought I'd use it as an opportunity to also learn version control - partly because I'm working on multiple machines and google docs never syncs properly.

Nothing much to see here. If you've found this somehow and are actually in the same subject as me, maybe don't tell the tutor/lecturer that all my code is available online, that's not going to turn out well for anyone at all (mainly me). I'm sure open source is basically the antithesis to anti-collusion rules etc.
