A simple guessing game. The aim of the game is to pick the number the computer is thinking of.
The number can be 1 - 100, and you get three guesses. After each incorrect guess, you'll get 
a clue - higher or lower. If you guess correctly, you win ten imaginary dollars, and your win 
is recorded. Temporarily. If your last guess + "was close to the mark, you get five imaginary dollars. 
Enjoy, or whatever.
